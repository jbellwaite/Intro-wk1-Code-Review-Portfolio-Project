# JBW Web Portfolio

#### Jessie's Web Portfolio Assignment, Friday, September 8, 2017

#### By Jessie Waite

## Description

_This is a website designed to provide an overview of the items that we've learned in Epicodus class so far. This fulfills the class assignment requirements to include HTML, CSS and Bootstrap styles, include specific tags, commits, and deployment to GitHub. This project includes custom-made style sheets that use cascading, the box model, and floats. This project is as polished as possible, given the time limits._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _You will need to access this document via Epicenter and use a web-browser, preferably Chrome, to view the content._

## Known Bugs

_I had to use a work-around to get my list items to work properly within the panels. For some reason, the list items (li) would not stack on top of one another, and smooshed together in one line. To get around this, I had to add a <media-body> to each of the <li> items. It looks a little better, but I'm not sure what happened.

Also, for some reason the text in my About Me panel extends out the side of the panel. I"m not sure why or how to get it to stop._
