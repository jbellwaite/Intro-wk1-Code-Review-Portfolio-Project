              <p>I graduated from University of Oregon in 2010 with a degree in Political Science. Instead of going to law school as I originally intended, I took a position with a company in Beaverton, Oregon, where I monitored a whistle-blower hotline. In that position, I helped people anonymously report ethics, compliance, legal, and human resorce issues happening in their workplace. The work was fascinating, but I quickly burned out. From there, I took a position with a construction company's safety department where I managed OSHA compliance. I investigated construction accidents, compiled root cause analysis reports, and helped make the workplace a safer place.

              <p>In 2017, I was really bored with my job and really dreaded doing something similar for a different company, so I began to look around for other prospects. A friend's boyfriend had taken classes at Epicodus in Seattle and recommended the program. So, I decided to just go for it. My friends and family were a little skeptical, but supportive. And now I'm here!
